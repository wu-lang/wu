An expression oriented, gradually typed and mission-critical programming language.

## Syntax

A full walk-through of the language can be found over at the [wu-lang documentation](https://wu-lang.gitbook.io/guide/).

### Details

Wu strives to be a decently useful language with focus on control, readability and scalability. The syntax of Wu is heavily inspired by the strong and safe one of Rust, while keeping the advantages of being high-level and gradually typed. The language is meant and designed to be a solid alternative to Python, Lua and MoonScript, while being superior on control and maintainability.
